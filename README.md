This repository contains K-Modes and K-Prototypes clustering analyses performed using an original dataset focusing on factors contributing to diabetes.
The objective of these data modeling exercises was to explore how different clustering methodologies can be applied to segment populations with Type I diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-diabetes.
As a result, two K-Prototypes models and one K-Modes model were developed to segment patients, non-patients, and mixed populations (Type I diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-patients) based on distinctive features.
Each segment's features were described in detail, followed by an analysis of the healthcare, insurance, and policy implications for the identified segments.
